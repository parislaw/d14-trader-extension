# Icon Placeholders

This directory contains placeholder icon files. For a production version, you would need actual PNG files at these sizes:

- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon32.png (32x32 pixels) 
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

## Creating Icons

The icons should represent the trading discipline theme. Consider:
- A calendar or streak symbol
- Trading chart with checkmark
- Simple "14" with progress indicator
- Shield representing discipline/protection

For now, you can create simple icons using any image editor or use online icon generators.

The icons should use the dark theme colors:
- Primary: #10b981 (green)
- Background: #1a2332 (dark blue)
- Accent: #ffffff (white)
